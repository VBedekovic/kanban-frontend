# Kanban Frontend

This is the frontend application for a Kanban board, built with Angular. It provides a user interface for managing tasks, columns, and workflow in a Kanban-style board.

## Prerequisites

This project requires the [kanban-api backend](https://github.com/VBedekovic/kanban-api) to be running for full functionality. Please clone and start the backend repository before running the frontend.

## Local Development

```
ng serve
```

This will start the development server, and the application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/` by default.
